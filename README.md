This project deals with credit card transactions analysis via generating queries using SQL.

Table data is taken from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/analyzing-credit-card-spending-habits-in-india
It is based on credit card transaction habits across 986 cities in India with 4 different credit card types and 6 different expense types.It ranges from 4th October 2013 to 26th May 2015,i.e.for 600 days.

By leveraging following SQL queries,actionable insights regarding the data of credit card transactions can be drawn, hence enabling informed decision-making for the stakeholders:

1.Top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends

2.Highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type

3.Transaction details(all columns from the table) for each card type when it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends(We should have 4 rows in the o/p one for each card type)

4.City which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type

5.Print 3 columns: city, highest_expense_type , lowest_expense_type (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel)

6.Percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type

7.Card type and expense type combination having highest month over month growth

8.During weekends which city has highest total spend to total no of transcations ratio

9.City which took least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction in that city

**Business Insights**: Analyzing top spending cities to further understand their demographics and spending pattern,identifying existence of seasonal trends or promotional activites linked to specific card types,city specific spending preferences and female customer behavior,thereby identify potential areas to target marketing efforts towards them.It also suggests potential for targeted promotions or special offers during weekends and higher card adoption rates or a more concentrated customer base in cities with high transaction rates.

_A deeper understanding of customer base in order to optimize marketing campaigns, develop targeted product offerings and improve overall business strategies._
